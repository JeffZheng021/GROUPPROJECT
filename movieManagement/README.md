## Getting Started

Welcome to our movieManagement System. This application has a GUI you can use to interact.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> To run the files, kindly goes to WelcomePage.java, select "Run" (On Right-hand top side for vscode, Top-mid for ecllipse) to run the application.
> *** Remember to make JavaFx runs properly before-hand, otherwise this application will not run!!!!!
>

> For Password, simply check manager_data.txt for a sample Manager's username and password.(You can add in your own later on, or just change in the txt file but make it stay in the format it is. ***Also always leave a newline at the end of file !!!) 
> Movies only have 5 in the current system, but can be later on changed since this is still a work in progress.
> We will also implement TV series later on, which will work similar to Movies that is avaliable right now.
